like we always talked about, because you're so excited for me. To finally drive up to your house, but today I drove through this summer. Crying because you weren't around. And you're probably with that blind girl who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me. She's everything I'm insecure about. Yet today I drove through this summer. It's how could I ever love someone else? And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one. And I just can imagine how you could be so gay, not that I would come. Guess you didn't mean what you're worried that's so about me. She's such forever now, I drive alone past your street. And all my friends are tired. If you're in how much I miss you, but I can't feel sorry for them. Cause they'll never know you the way that I do yet to dare drove through this summer. And pick shit I was driving home to you. And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one. And I just can imagine how you could be so gay, not that I would come. Guess you didn't mean what you're worried that's so about me. Guess you said forever now, I drive alone past your street. And all my friends are tired. I still see your face in no one, because my friends can't drive past the places we used to go to. Cause I still fucking love you baby. Side looks, we cross, I still hear your voice in the traffic we're laughing. Over all the noise, got up so blue, no way. And I still feel so blue, no way. But I still fucking love you baby. I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one. And I just can imagine how you could be so gay, not that I would come. Guess you didn't mean what you're worried that's so about me. Guess you said forever now, I drive alone past your street. And you said forever now, I drive alone past your street.\n"," Result: Video is okay.
